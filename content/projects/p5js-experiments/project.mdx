I spent a while using p5.js to explore different coding concepts, like bezier curves or interpolation.
I decided to organise them in a little website, since I think a few of them are neat.

The pages for each p5.js sketch are dynamically created by dynamically importing the sketch, and loading some data from a .mdx file.

This was a useful exercise to test that out before using the same method to create the description you're reading right now!
